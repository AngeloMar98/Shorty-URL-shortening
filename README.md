## My process

Starting with the logic of the page:
For this project, although really simpled I started by making some user stories to focus on a high level on what I wanted to implement, after making enough user stories I focused on how to segment the features. Which functions I wanted to make and how to implement them, once I had all the functions I needed in mind I created a [flowchart](https://app.diagrams.net/#G1u5sjfvfQVHWo0NWXTF8XCM0DEcQue9ep) to set in stone how the project and events in the page would flow.

For the styling side of things I relied on tailwind, choosing a mobile-first approach and preparing the elements that would have been inserted through user input really easily this way.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tyepscript
- TailwindCSS
